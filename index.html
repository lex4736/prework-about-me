      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p> Hello and welcome to my webpage. I am a full time financial professional in the bay area that want to transition into the tech world. I have dabbled with little bit of web development mixed with graphic design
         in the past just by following online tutorials and lots of practice. There is still a lot i am not familiar with so I am taking this course in hopes that I can
          expand my knowledge in this field. 
           </p>

      <p> I was born in the Phillipines but moved to the US when i was a kid. I have been in the Bay Area ever since</p>

         I also like the flexibility of being able to work from anywhere in the world. </p>
